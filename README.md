#Machin Learning Model : Logistic Regression


NOTE ðŸ’¡ : All functions used in this model are created from scratch

run the "Preprocessing and preparation data" file
the file will read the original dataset and create two files
"InputsNormalization.csv" and "OutputsNormalization.csv"

the rest of the files (programs) use these two generated files as inputs and outputs

Before i build this Machin learning model, I needed to clean and split the dataset, separate it into 3 parts, train, cross validation and test.
Camparize the results through the evaluation functions "accuracy, recall, precision .." and modify the possible parameters, regularization, the jump of arrangement(rate learning) and the number of iterations.
